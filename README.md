# NOAA Lake Temperature Analysis Program
This temperature analysis program developed for the Great Lakes of Canada is a comprehensive tool that uses C programming concepts such as arrays, pointers, functions, and sorting algorithms to analyze the NOAA data. The program is designed to take real data from the NOAA for the period of 2019 to 2020 and provides insights into various factors such as the average yearly temperatures, temperatures specific to different seasons, and the highest and lowest temperatures. The program is implemented in a single C file and is capable of organizing and calculating multiple elements.

It utilizes a variety of functions in C to calculate the yearly average temperatures, hottest/coldest days of the year, indicates the warmest water temperatures with dates correlating to each of the 6 lakes, calculates the warmest water temperature in summer and winter, and finally, the number of days when the great lakes are frozen. The program's ability to calculate such a wide range of factors makes it a valuable tool for researchers, environmentalists, and policymakers interested in the Great Lakes' climate. With its powerful algorithms and user-friendly interface, the program provides accurate and detailed analysis that can aid in decision-making processes and contribute to a better understanding of the Great Lakes' climate.
